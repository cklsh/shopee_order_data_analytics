Customer Segmentation Report (KMeans Clustering)
The customer segmentation analysis conducted using KMeans clustering on 2024 sales data, focusing on four behavioral variables: total orders, total spent, recency (days since last purchase), and average order value (AOV). The goal was to identify meaningful customer groups based on their purchasing patterns and engagement level to inform marketing and retention strategies.

The analysis identified 4 distinct customer segments:

Cluster 0 (Churned Customers): These customers made very few purchases, spent little, and have not returned in a long time. They represent disengaged or lost customers who may need reactivation campaigns.

Cluster 1 (New or Light Buyers): Recent but low-spending customers who have made minimal purchases. These users are potential long-term buyers if nurtured properly.

Cluster 2 (Loyal Customers): These users order frequently and consistently, with solid spending patterns. They are your core repeat buyers and are worth targeting with loyalty programs.

Cluster 3 (High-Spending VIPs): Though they order infrequently, their average order value is the highest. They represent high-value customers who deserve premium service or exclusive offers.

This segmentation can guide personalized marketing efforts: for example, offering win-back promos to Cluster 0, onboarding nudges to Cluster 1, loyalty rewards for Cluster 2, and luxury perks for Cluster 3. With these insights, your team can better allocate resources to retain and grow customer value across each segment.
